# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System  

Welcome to my **Movie Recommendation System** project!  
This web app recommends movies using **content-based filtering** powered by TF-IDF vectorization and Pinecone for fast similarity search.

## 🚀 Features  

- Get **personalized movie recommendations** based on a selected title.  
- Apply **genre filters** for more relevant suggestions.  
- Browse an **interactive UI** built with Streamlit.

## ⚡ How It Works  

1. **Load dataset** with movie metadata (title, genres, tags).  
2. **Preprocess data** using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity.  
3. **Store embeddings** in Pinecone for efficient vector search.  
4. **Select a movie** → get **top 12 similar recommendations**.  
5. Posters and details are displayed in the Streamlit app.
